# Takataka - Swahili for rubbish. Experimental static site generator

I built this to understand how Python's [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican) works.

Please see this blog [post](http://mawuli.me/posts/2013/Apr/13/why-so-many-static-site-generators/) on how Takataka works, and alternative, stable and production ready
 static site generators to use.

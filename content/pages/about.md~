###Hey, nice to meet you!

I'm Mawuli Adzaku. 
I have always been passionately curious about how things work. 
After cracking open a few gadgets(esp Mum's radio) in primary school, I finally decided to learn how to program computers.
The journey is longer than i expected, but sunny side definitely up. 


I do mostly web stuff professionally, but Iâ€™m very interested in compilers, and AI.


This blog is for documenting and sharing some of my experiments.

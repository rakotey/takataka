Hey, nice to meet you!
I'm Mawuli Adzaku. 
I have always been passionately curious about how things work. 
After cracking open a few gadgets(esp Mum's radio) in primary school, I finally decided to learn how to program computers.
The journey is longer than i expected, but sunny side definitely up. 

I do mostly web stuff professionally, but Iâ€™m very interested in compilers, operating systems and AI.
I am currently in my final year at University of Cape Coast, Ghana

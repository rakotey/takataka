##Philosophy
I think of programming as a form of art. Code should
be beautiful.

##Abstraction
Although I have a great eye for detail, I have a constant need to
abstract complex problems into simple, elegant solutions. A
technical design does not have to be complicated to be good.

##Solutions
Should be simple, easy to re-develop, and consume as little
resources as possible.


##What is your work style?

I consider myself a self-motivated developer. Sometimes I like to fully analyze a problem before coding it. Sometimes I find it easier to start coding to help understand a problem. I also love working in small teams, because I believe that is the best way to mature as a developer.



##What are your career goals?

I want to grow as a developer, both professionally and personally. I would like a position which encourages working on side projects, creativity, learning new languages, and exploring new technologies. I would like to play a larger role in the design and development of new technologies.



##Why should we hire you?
Because, I am a cool guy who gets things done, i love sharing knowledge and learning from others.


## Systems for Living Well
A list of some of my favourite quotes, and words that guide my present life. 
I do not remember the original authors of some of the quotes though.
